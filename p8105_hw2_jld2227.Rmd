## Problem 1
Instructions: "Read and clean the data; retain line, station, name, station latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA compliance. Convert the entry variable from character (YES vs NO) to a logical variable (the ifelse or recode function may be useful)."
```{r data_import}
subway_data = read_csv("./problem1/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(c("line","station_name","station_latitude","station_longitude",
           starts_with("route"),"entry","vending","ada")) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry,"YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE))
subway_data 
```
